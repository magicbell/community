title: Adding MagicBell to your NuxtJS Application
---

## Quickstart

Though we do not offer a native Vue UI library at the moment, you can use
the embeddable package to render a MagicBell component in your VuxtJS App.

You can either grab it from our CDN or install the embeddable package from NPM.

```shell hideHeader
npm install @magicbell/embeddable
# Or
yarn add @magicbell/embeddable
```

After successfully installing the package, you will need to create a plugin file for MagicBell by creating a file called `magicbell.client.js` in the `plugins` folder

```js
// plugins/magicbell.client.js
import { renderWidget } from '@magicbell/embeddable/dist/magicbell.esm.js';

const MagicBellPlugin = ({ _app }, inject) => {
  inject('magicbell', renderWidget);
};

export default MagicBellPlugin;
```

If you prefer to use the CDN bundle, replace the import statement (line 2) with

```javascript
import { renderWidget } from 'https://unpkg.com/@magicbell/embeddable';
```

After that, you will need to update your `nuxt.config.js` file and add the newly created plugin to the plugin array as well as the plugin to the transpile list. Your config should look like this:

```js
plugins: ['~/plugins/magicbell.client.js'],
transpile: ['@magicbell/embeddable/dist/magicbell.esm.js']
```

If you now want to use the Widget in your code, create a `<div />` in the template and give it a `ref` so it can be referenced via the code.
After that, you will need to use the referenced `<div />` to mount the MagicBell widget. You can do that by accessing the plugin using `this.$magicbell`.

The finished code should look like that

```javascript title=Vue
// MagicBell.vue
<template>
    <div ref="notifications" />
</template>
<script>
export default {
    mounted(){
        const magicbellOptions = {
            apiKey: this.$config.MAGICBELL_API_KEY,
            userExternalId: 'some-id',
            // other customization options:
            // http://magicbell.com/docs/browser/changing-default-font
        }
        this.$magicbell(this.$refs.notifications, magicbellOptions)
    }
}
</script>
```

If you followed all steps you should have awesome Notifications in your NuxtJS application!
