subtitle: How to send a notification from the MagicBell dashboard
---

Sometimes you may not want to send notifications programmatically. Perhaps
there's a product update to make all users aware of, or a promotion to send to a
group of users. You can even test notifications by sending one-offs to yourself.

The Compose feature is the way to send notifications using our application's
interface instead of the API.

## Recipients

Enter the email addresses or external IDs of the desired recipients, select from [segments](/docs/segments), or pick `everyone` to notify your entire userbase. Make sure your users are synced with MagicBell by using our [create users API](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-a-user) to add a user each time one is added to your system.

## Notification title

The title will be the subject of emails, and the first, bolded line for in-app
notifications.

## Content

Content is the body of your notification - the message you want to pass onto
users. Content will be the body of an email and below the notification title for
in-app notifications.

The content input supports HTML. You can insert header, image, and other HTML
tags. You can generate HTML for rich notifications [on this page](https://html-online.com/editor/).

## Category

Optionally, pick a category for this notification. [Categories](/docs/categories) control the delivery channels that the notification will be delivered on.

The content input supports HTML. You can insert header, image, and other HTML
tags.

## Action URL

Clicking the notification directs the user to the action URL.
