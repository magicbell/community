MagicBell offers you the ability to send notifications your users via slack.

To simplify integrating with slack as much as possible we've created 2 slack applications that you can install into your internal slack workspace(s). This will get you up and running in next to no time with little to no setup required on your end.

MagicBell also allows you to create your own branded slack app that can then be set up in your MagicBell project. This will allow you to seemlessly communicate with your customers.

**MagicBell can even reuse your existing slack apps to deliver your notifications.**

### There are some pros and cons to each of the different ways MagicBell integrates with slack.

**MagicBell's slack apps**

Pros:

- Simple to install, a couple of clicks will integrate MagicBell into your slack workspace.

Cons:

- You need to be the MagicBell project owner and have permissions to install apps in the slack workspace.

**Creating your own slack app**

Pros:

- You can customize and style it to your heart's content.

Cons:

- There is some manual setup requred to get MagicBell communicating with it
