subtitle: Learn how to use the MagicBell REST API
---

This section describes the resources that make up the official MagicBell REST
API. Use it to send notifications to your users and retrieve notifications
previously sent to a user, change their state, delete them, etc.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from https://api.magicbell.com. It
utilizes standard HTTP response codes and returns JSON responses.

The MagicBell REST API is described in an OpenAPI 3.0 document.

[Download the OpenAPI Spec from our public repository on Github](https://github.com/magicbell-io/public/blob/main/openapi/spec/openapi.json)

## Client errors

The MagicBell REST API utilizes [HTTP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
to indicate the success or failure of an API request. A `2xx` response code
indicates success, and a `4xx` response code means that the API request is
incorrect (like when a required parameter is missing or a resource, like a user,
could not be found). A `5xx` response code indicates an error in MagicBell's
servers. These are rare, and we always act quickly to solve them.

When the API responds with a `4xx` response code, the response body includes an
array that contains all the errors that have happened. For example:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "api_secret_not_provided",
      "message": "API Secret not provided"
    }
  ]
}
```

As shown above, some errors also have a `code` that briefly describes the error
that has happened. These are the possible error codes:

- `api_key_not_provided`
- `incorrect_api_key`
- `api_secret_not_provided`
- `api_secret_is_incorrect`
- `forbidden`
- `neither_user_hmac_nor_api_secret_provided`
- `user_email_not_provided`

You can handle these errors and take necessary action, like displaying an
appropriate error message to the users or reporting the event to your error
tracker. For example:

```js title=Node
const axios = require('axios');

const headers = {
  'X-MAGICBELL-API-SECRET': 'MAGICBELL_API_SECRET',
  'X-MAGICBELL-API-KEY': 'MAGICBELL_API_KEY',
};

const data = {
  notification: {
    title: "We're processing your order",
  },
};

axios.post('https://api.magicbell.com/notifications', data, headers).catch((error) => {
  const { response } = error;
  ErrorTracker.notify(response.data, response.status);
});
```

## Timestamps

All timestamps returned by the REST API are in seconds since the Unix epoch.

## Rate limiting

The REST API imposes a limit of 200 requests per second by project. If the limit is exceeded, you will get an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response.
