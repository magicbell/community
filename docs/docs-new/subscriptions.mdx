Subscriptions allow users to subscribe to and unsubscribe from specific [topics](/docs/topics). Continuing with our GitHub example:

1. Jane would like to receive all notifications related to comments on pull requests.
1. Jane subscribes to the topic `pull-request`.
1. When a notification is sent in MagicBell with any topic for which `pull-request` is a substring (e.g., `pull-request-1234` or `pull-request.1234`) of the topic, Jane will be notified.
1. Jane then sees that `pull-request-1234` is being handled by one of their peers and, due to the constant back and forth, decides they no longer want to be notified about this.
1. Jane unsubscribes from `pull-request-1234` and stops receiving notifications for that pull request, but will continue to be notified of others.

## Creating notifications for subscribers

The `{ "topic": { "subscribers": true } }` recipient can be used to send notifications to subscribers. It can be used on its own or along with other recipients. If this recipient is not specified, the notification will only be sent to the designated recipients.

```json hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "@unamashana please review this PR",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "hana@magicbell.io",
        "external_id": "00001"
      },
      {
        "topic": {
          "subscribers": true
        }
      }
    ],
    "topic": "pull-request-123",
    "category": "comment"
  }
}
```

## How users are subscribed

Users are automatically subscribed to the combination of topic and category when they are specified as a recipient on a notification. If no category is provided for the notification the subscription record will match all categories. As an alternative, users can be manually subscribed to a topic/category with the following process:

1. When a user want to subscribes to a topic, the app should send a [POST request](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-topic-subscription) to the subscriptions endpoint.
1. A subscription record is then created with the status `subscribed`. You can [unsubscribe](/docs/rest-api/reference#unsubscribe-topic-subscription) and [resubscribe](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-topic-subscription) the user using the REST API.
1. Whenever a matching category & topic is used in a notification, the user will receive the notification.

## How users can unsubscribe

When sending a notification you can use the `{{ unsubscribe_url }}` merge tag to generate a URL for the specific recipient and the notification's topic — this can be used in [templates](/docs/templates), [email layout](/docs/email-layouts), and in notification content. When the unsubscribe link requires the category as well use `{{ unsubscribe_url | category: "current" }}`.

As we don't generate unsubscribe URLs when a topic isn't specified for a notification, consider using [control flow](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/) to avoid an empty object being rendered in your notification:

```html title=LIQUID noTopBorderRadius
{% if unsubscribe_url != "" %} Click here to
<a href="{{ unsubscribe_url }}">unsubscribe</a>. {% endif %}
```

<Note>
  When a user unsubscribes from a topic, they will no longer receive notifications for
  that topic, even if they are a recipient of the notification.
