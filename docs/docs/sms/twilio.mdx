## Deliver SMS notifications with your Twilio account

To configure Twilio for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and obtain your account SID and auth token from the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
1. From the **Settings &rarr; Channels** page in your dashboard, select **Add Provider &rarr; Twilio **.
1. Enable the provider and enter the credentials from step 1.
1. In the **From** field, enter a Twilio phone number in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164), then click **Save**.

  style={{ width: '100%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>
After that, the only thing that remains after that is to ensure you [add phone numbers to
your MagicBell users](/docs/rest-api/reference#update-user).
