subtitle: Setup Safari web push notifications on MagicBell
---

To deliver push notifications from your web app you need to register a new web push identifier and create a key for it in the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). MagicBell will use P12 tokens to authenticate requests made to the APNs.

1. Login to your [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account) and click on **Certificates, IDs & Profiles**.
1. Open the Identifiers page and click on the plus icon to register a new identifier. Select **Website push IDs** and press **Continue**.
1. Fill in the form, press **Continue** and then **Register**.
1. Open Certificates and click the plus icon. Choose **Website Push ID Certificate**, and press **Continue**.
1. In the next screen select a Website Push ID for this certificate. Now you have to upload a certificate — follow the instructions on that page if you don't know how to generate one.
1. Now, download the generated certificate and open it in the Keychain app. Right click on it and select the export option from the context menu. Export the certificate in p12 format.
