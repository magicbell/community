---

The MagicBell GraphQL API enables you to create precise and flexible queries,
aggregate data, and type data. You might find it very useful for implementing
your notification system.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `https://api.magicbell.com/graphql`.

You can perform introspection against the API directly or visit
[MagicBell's Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/magicbell-api/workspace/magicbell)
to download the schema.

## Pagination

Our GraphQL API implements [Relay pagination](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm),
a cursor-based pagination model based on the connection pattern.

- Pagination is done with the `after` argument
- Slicing is done with the `first` argument
- Cursors are opaque strings
- A connection contains a field called `edges`, which is a list type
- Each edge contains a field called `node`
- A connection also contains a field called `pageInfo`, which contains the pagination data

For example, this query:

```graphql
query {
  notifications(first: 1, after: "opaqueCursor") {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        title
        content
        category
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

produces

```json
{
  "data": {
    "notifications": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "anotherOpaqueCursor",
          "node": {
            "id": "83d987a-83fd034",
            "title": "We're processing your order",
            "content": "<p>Thank you for your order. We'll notify you when these items are ready.</p>",
            "category": "order_created"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "hasNextPage": false,
        "hasPreviousPage": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate limiting

The GraphQL API imposes a limit of 200 requests per second per project. Requests exceeding this limit will return an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response.
