title: Announcements
subtitle: How to send a notification to all users
---

## Two options

- Programatically
- Using the Dashboard

## Programmatically

All users can receive a notification by using [segmentation in the API](/docs/segments#how-to-create-segments-using-the-api). In `notification.recipients`, include the `matches` attribute with a `*` as the value. Now, all users will receive the notification!

```shell hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "We are processing your order",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "matches": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The Dashboard

To send a notification to all users, simply open Compose, click Recipients, and select Everyone.

## FAQ: Can you be more specific when you say <i>all</i> users receive announcements?

An announcement will be sent to all users who have logged into your application and used MagicBell, or recieved a notification in the past. Otherwise, we do not know the user exists.

### Sync your users

Make sure your users are synced with MagicBell by using our [create users API](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-a-user) to add a user each time one is added to your system.
