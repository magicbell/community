## Server Side Rendering

Frameworks like Next.js and Remix, render your react components on the server before shipping them to the client. Our
React SDK does not offer support for server-side rendering at this moment. The work around is to prevent rendering on
the server, and only render MagicBell on the client.

```jsx
import MagicBell, { FloatingNotificationInbox } from '@magicbell/magicbell-react';

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {typeof window !== 'undefined' ? (
        <MagicBell apiKey="..." userEmail="...">
          {(props) => <FloatingNotificationInbox {...props} />}
        </MagicBell>
      ) : null}
    </nav>
  );
}
```
